# The Elementalist
**Project Description**
The Elementalist is a 2D sidescrolling brawler game. Inspired by the TV show _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ and rogue-like games, the player chooses an element to wield and fight enemies in endless waves. This game was created using Python 3.7 and its PyGame module, in collaboration with several other individuals: Amjad Halis, Justin Bains, Mohamed Sharaawy, and Rasheed Amanzai. 

**Project Purpose**
The purpose of making this project is to make a functional game with infinite progression, as an assignment in our grade 12 computer science class. This project will help us to further develop our skills in programming, as well as game development and project management.

**Project Objectives**
Our first and immediate objective was to organize our group effectively, giving tasks to everyone in order to evenly distribute the workload and increase work efficiency. Utilizing project management tools such as Gantt charts, we strived to manage our time effectively and set a schedule. Once the game was mostly finished, we dedicated some time to test out the game and see how it runs in order to patch any bugs before submitting the final product.

**Details of the Game**
The player and enemies have basic 2D movement, with enemies constantly following the player. Each element has a special characteristic, they are as follows: Fire (Damage), Earth (Tank), Water (Healing), and Air (Agility). The combat system consist of projectile spells and an ability to evade enemy attacks. There are several enemy types: Normal, Champion, and Boss, in order of increasing difficulty. As the game progresses these enemies will slowly be harder to eliminate, whilst dealing more damage to the player.
